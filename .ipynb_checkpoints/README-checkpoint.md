# Deep Learning

In this assignment, I used deep learning recurrent neural networks to model bitcoin closing prices. One model uses the FNG indicators to predict the closing price while the second model uses a window of closing prices to predict the nth closing price.

I used the two models to answer the follwoing questions: 

>Which model has a lower loss?
>>The first model, using the FNG indicators to predict the closing price, had lower loss. 

>Which model tracks the actual values better over time?
>>

>Which window size works best for the model?
